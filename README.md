# Exercise Tracker

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Back End Development and API certification. It serves as an exercise tracker API, allowing users to create accounts, log exercises, and retrieve exercise logs. The API supports functionalities such as creating a new user, adding exercises, and retrieving exercise logs for a user within a specified date range.

**Usage:**
- Create a new user: `POST /api/users`
- Log exercises: `POST /api/users/:_id/exercises`
- Retrieve exercise logs: `GET /api/users/:_id/logs?[from][&to][&limit]`
